Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation
This repository showcases my work and solutions from the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation, completed via Forage. This virtual experience provided hands-on practice with a real-world data analytics project, mirroring the tasks and challenges faced by Accenture professionals.

About the Simulation
The Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation is designed to replicate a client engagement, where participants analyze data and derive insights to support business decisions. My journey covered critical aspects of data analytics, including data quality assessment, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, visualization, and presentation of findings.

Project Objectives
The core objectives of this simulation were to:

Gain practical experience in data analysis and visualization.
Apply data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure data quality.
Utilize data analytics tools and techniques for exploratory data analysis.
Develop meaningful visualizations and dashboards to effectively communicate insights.
Provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis to address client business challenges.
My Role and Key Contributions
As a simulated Data Analyst for a hypothetical social media client at Accenture, I:

Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed seven diverse datasets to uncover content trends and inform strategic decisions.
Prepared a comprehensive PowerPoint deck and a video presentation to communicate key insights effectively to both the client and internal stakeholders.
Project Breakdown
My work followed a structured approach, typical of a professional data analytics project:

1. Project Understanding
I thoroughly understood the client's needs and the primary objectives of the data analysis.
2. Data Cleaning & Modeling
I worked with three core datasets: content, reaction, and reaction types.
My key tasks involved removing irrelevant columns and rows to ensure data quality and relevance for subsequent analysis.
3. Data Visualization & Storytelling
I focused on primary and secondary data columns to extract meaningful insights.
I then translated these insights into compelling visualizations, crafting a clear and effective data story.
My analysis specifically aimed to identify peak app usage months and determine the highest-scoring content categories based on their performance scores.
4. Present to the Client
I prepared and delivered a detailed presentation to the client, outlining my key findings and providing actionable recommendations derived directly from the data analysis.
