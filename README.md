Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation
I recently completed the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation, a project that encompassed the full data analysis lifecycle. My responsibilities included:

Project Understanding: Gaining a clear understanding of the client's needs and the objectives of the data analysis.
Data Cleaning & Modeling: Meticulously cleaning and modeling three provided datasets (content, reaction, and reaction types). This involved identifying and removing irrelevant columns and rows to ensure data quality and relevance for analysis.
Data Visualization & Storytelling: Analyzing primary and secondary data columns to extract meaningful insights. I then translated these insights into compelling visualizations to tell a clear data story.
Present to the Client: Preparing and delivering a presentation to the client, outlining key findings and actionable recommendations. My analysis specifically focused on identifying peak app usage months and determining the highest-scoring content categories.
